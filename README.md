# Orientation & Integrity AI

This repository is a unified project space focused on orientation integrity in AI systems — including temporal anchoring, contextual stability, and second-order system awareness.

The work is organized into three parallel components (TAI, 2SAI, and essays). TAI is the primary technical framework of the project, while 2SAI and the essays provide complementary system-level and explanatory layers.

The repository is intentionally structured as a shared reference space rather than a single-paper archive.
