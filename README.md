# Orientation & Integrity AI

This repository is a unified project space focused on orientation integrity in AI systems — including temporal anchoring, contextual stability, and second-order system awareness.

TAI (Temporal Anchoring & Integrity) is the core framework of the project and serves as its canonical technical foundation.
Additional components include 2SAI (Second-Order System Awareness & Integrity) and explanatory essays that expand, contextualize, and translate the core ideas.

The repository is intentionally structured as a shared reference space rather than a single-paper archive.
